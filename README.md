# ElixirChat

This sample application demonstrates how an Elixir application on the Phoenix
framework might look.

It happens to be a simple chatroom using Phoenix's Channels -- a thin
abstraction over websockets to allow for flexible sending and consumption of
messages between different technologies. But the main purpose of this
application is to demonstrate how an Elixir app can be constructed, built
into a release, and deployed.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install && cd ..`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your
browser.
